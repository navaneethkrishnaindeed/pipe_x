/// ðŸŒ¿ Reactive hub that manages state with automatic disposal
///
/// [Hub] provides lifecycle management and reactive state management
/// for [Pipe] instances. Pipes created in the hub are automatically
/// registered and disposed - no manual registration needed!
///
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// class CounterHub extends Hub {
///   // âœ¨ Automatic registration - just create the Pipe!
///   late final count = Pipe(0);
///   late final name = Pipe('John');
///   late final user = Pipe(User(name: 'Jane', age: 25));
///
///   // Use getters for derived/computed values
///   bool get isEven => count.value % 2 == 0;
///   String get displayText => 'Count: ${count.value} (${isEven ? "Even" : "Odd"})';
///
///   // No need for checkNotDisposed()! Pipe checks automatically
///   void increment() => count.value++;
/// }
/// ```
